# Airbnb-data-analysis: New Zealand

This project aims to analyze the Airbnb Dataset, focusing specifically on the country of New Zealand, using SQL, Excel, and Tableau for visualizations. To my surprise, these findings provide exciting insights towards the variation of prices via location along with other elements to comprehend how the pricing varies with location, property type, and reviews in order to predict the future performance of Airbnb in New Zealand.
